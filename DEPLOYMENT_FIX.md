# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
The issue was with your `vercel.json` configuration file. You were using the deprecated `builds` field which was causing Vercel to ignore your project settings and potentially not deploy the Python function correctly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
- Simplified configuration to let Vercel auto-detect Python functions
- Removed explicit runtime specifications that were causing errors
- Kept the routing configuration intact

### 2. Added `api/requirements.txt`
- Created a requirements.txt file in the api directory
- This helps Vercel properly detect and install Python dependencies

### 3. Fixed Configuration
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.py"
    },
    {
      "src": "/admin",
      "dest": "admin.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel configuration - remove deprecated builds field"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Trigger a new deployment (it should happen automatically after the push)
   - Wait for the deployment to complete

3. **Test the deployment:**
   - Run the test script: `python3 test_vercel_deployment.py`
   - Or manually test: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/employees`

## Expected Results
After redeployment, your Vercel app should:
- ✅ Successfully deploy the Python backend function
- ✅ Respond to API requests at `/api/*` endpoints
- ✅ Connect to Google Sheets using your credentials
- ✅ Serve the frontend at the root URL

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist after redeployment:
1. Check Vercel function logs in the dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are still set correctly
3. Test individual API endpoints manually
4. Check for any CORS issues in browser console
